"""DNS resolution utilities for IRIS.

Provides fallback DNS resolution via public DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) when the
system resolver blocks known-phishing domains.  Many ISP / router-level DNS
resolvers silently drop queries for domains on blocklists, causing
``ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`` in headless Chromium even though the domain is
still live.

The resolved IP can be fed to Chromium's ``--host-resolver-rules`` flag so
that Playwright can still reach the site for analysis.
